# # # Tic-Tac-Toe, sometimes also known as Xs and Os,
# is a game for two players (X and O) who take turns marking the spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid.
# The player who succeeds in placing three respective marks in a horizontal, vertical,
# or diagonal rows (NW-SE and NE-SW) wins the game.
# # #
# # # But we will not be playing this game.
# You will be the referee for this games results.
# You are given a result of a game and you must determine
# if the game ends in a win or a draw as well as who will be the winner.
# Make sure to return "X" if the X-player wins and "O" if the O-player wins.
# If the game is a draw, return "D".
# # A game's result is presented as a list of strings,
# where "X" and "O" are players' marks and "." is the empty cell.
# #
# # Input: A game result as a list of strings (unicode).
# #
# # Output: "X", "O" or "D" as a string.
# #
# # Example:
# #
# # checkio([
# #     "X.O",
# #     "XX.",
# #     "XOO"]) == "X"
# # checkio([
# #     "OO.",
# #     "XOX",
# #     "XOX"]) == "O"
# # checkio([
# #     "OOX",
# #     "XXO",
# #     "OXX"]) == "D"
# #
# # How it is used: The concepts in this task will help you when iterating data types.
# They can also be used in game algorithms, allowing you to know how to check results.
#
# Precondition:
# There is either one winner or a draw.
# len(game_result) == 3
# all(len(row) == 3 for row in game_result)
